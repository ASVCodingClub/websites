    <h1>IRELAND FOR TEENS:</h1>
    <h2 class="favorite">Description:</h2>
    <p> Ireland is an incredibly beautiful and wonderful country. You can see stunning landscapes green hills and much more as well as get acquainted with delicious local cuisine. But this website is for teens only, activities that would be fun and adventurous for them!</p>
    <h2>Three great places and things to do in Ireland for teens:</h2>
    <p>There are three places I would highly recommend to go to if you are in Ireland and you are a teen. First, I would recommend for you to go to Limerick city. If you like sports you should go to Thomond park. It is a huge rugby stadium. You can also go watch a game so that you can feel the spirit of the people. You can also go to the Rugby museum thats there. </p>
    <p>The second place that you can go to is the city of Dublin. It has a storied past dating back more than 1,000 years. Another thing that you could do in Dublin is head to the National Wax Museum where you can find human sized replicas of celebrities. You can also go to the restaurants that are there.</p>
    <p>Finally the last place that you can go is a small seaside town called Kilkee. It has a big beach where you can swim in the fresh water. There is a place called West coast Aqua park, which is in a town called Kilrush. It is a 10 minute drive from Kilkee. Its a big waterpark thats in a lake. You can also go on hikes on the cliffs by the sea.</p>
